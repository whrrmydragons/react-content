# react-content
This Project is an attempt to create a cms like boilerplate\framework in react.
The main idea is serializing components in the DB and deserializing them in the client,
this gives the developer the power to use any component previously utilized for use with this project, and it also give the user(if the developer chooses so) the power to use the "Fixed\Known" Components for new data and utility other than the original site.
